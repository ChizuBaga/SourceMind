# Welcome to SourceMind!
This is a very simple project built in a team of 4 in an AI camp to have a hands on experience. 😬*Basically a wrapper*🥲 <br>
It's a project where user provide PDF files and URLs and asks questions and get answers from the AI!
<br>

## Methods/Tools
Initially built on paid OpenAI APIs, and now we're utilizing open-source model from HuggingFace!
More specifically, <a href='https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B'>Qwen3 model!</a>🤓 <br>
A simple RAG model was also built to retrieve URL / PDF contents from user.
*Credits to this Youtuber for the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJxpyO3ei4&t=214s'>tutorial*</a>😀

<br>
Currently, this project is actively being improve, due to the unsatifactory of performance when utilizing different models due to different structures.
